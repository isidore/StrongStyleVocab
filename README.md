This is meant to help the Navigator and Driver in Strong Style Pairing or Mob Programming to communicate about the screen without grabbing the mouse or pointing to things.

If you have suggestions please send them via twitter ( [@LlewellynFalco](http://www.twitter.com/llewellynfalco ) )or github.

suggestions:
 * Better names ( use A instead of B)
 * Alternative Names ( use A or B depending on context, sometimes both)
 * Missing Screen area's or features


 Please share and improve.
